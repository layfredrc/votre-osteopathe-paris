							Tailwind makes writing CSS easier and lets us customize our
							designs faster than any other CSS framework. If you want a CSS
							framework that has pre-built components, then Tailwind may not be
							for you. If you want a CSS framework that lets you design quickly
							and customize your site, then
							<strong class="font-bold text-green-500"
								>Tailwind is gonna be a lot of fun.</strong

						</p>
						<p>
							After using Bulma to build
							<a href="https://scotch.io" class="text-green-500 hover:underline"
								>Scotch.io</a
							>, my CSS files became littered with my own
							<code
								class="inline-block px-1 rounded text-s bg-gray-200 font-mono text-red-700"
								>!important</code
							>
							classes to override the framework's styles. Tailwind doesn't have
							the
							<code
								class="inline-block px-1 rounded text-s bg-gray-200 font-mono text-red-700"
								>!important</code
							>
							problem since all our elements are designed on the fly.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong class="font-bold">Important Note:</strong> Tailwind lets
							us design quickly, but this doesn't mean that you don't need CSS
							knowledge however. To use Tailwind, you need to have a good
							understanding of CSS properties. In this course, we will learn
							Tailwind and we'll also learn CSS conceptsto create good looking
							designs.
							<strong class="font-bold"
								>Tailwind is the ultimate CSS shorthand</strong
							>, but we still need to learn the CSS, which we'll do in this
							course.

						<p class="relative text-3xl italic">
							<span
								class="absolute top-0 left-0 transform -translate-x-6 -translate-y-6 text-green-600 text-6xl opacity-50"
								>"</span
							>
							This isn't just a Tailwind course. This is also a "learn how to
							design with CSS" course.
						</p>
						<p>
							The hardest things about learning Tailwind is memorizing the
							classes and also knowing which classes go well together. We'll be
							writing a lot of Tailwind in this course so that the repetition
							will help us commit Tailwind classes to memory.
